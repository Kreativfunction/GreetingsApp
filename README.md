An elegant way to say "Hello.." to the programming world. :-)
-- Version 1.0
-----------------
--  HELLO USER --  
-----------------
The program has a simple and intuitive UI.
The application saves the strings entered by the user and returns the entered data with a short greeting's message.
The TextField is cleared after the "Enter" - command has been executed.
The user can enter information as many as desired or can also close the application at any time by clicking the "close" - button.

-- Do you think this should be improved? ? Any suggestion is welcome.
-- But don't forget: It's just a "Hello world!".
